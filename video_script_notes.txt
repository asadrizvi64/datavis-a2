SCRIPT OUTLINE (Timing: ~60 seconds total)
================================================================================

[0:00-0:10] INTRODUCTION (10 seconds)
----------------------------------------
"Hello! This is my interactive multivariate visualization of the cars dataset
for DataVis Assignment 2. I've created a scatterplot that encodes four
attributes simultaneously using different visual variables."

VISUAL: Show the full visualization on screen
TIP: Speak clearly and confidently


[0:10-0:30] VISUAL VARIABLES EXPLANATION (20 seconds)
------------------------------------------------------
"The four visual variables I'm using are:

1. POSITION X - Engine Size in liters on the horizontal axis
2. POSITION Y - Horsepower on the vertical axis
3. COLOR - Different colors represent car types: sedans, SUVs, sports cars,
   and wagons
4. SIZE - The size of each circle represents the retail price, so larger
   circles are more expensive cars"

VISUAL: Point to or highlight each visual variable as you mention it
TIP: Use your mouse cursor or screen annotation to show what you're describing


[0:30-0:45] INTERACTION DEMONSTRATION (15 seconds)
---------------------------------------------------
"The visualization is fully interactive. When you hover over a car, you see
quick details. When you click on any car..."

[CLICK ON A CAR]

"...you can see detailed information including the car name, price, engine
specs, and fuel efficiency. As a bonus feature, I've also included a star
plot that visualizes six performance metrics in a radial layout."

VISUAL: Actually click on a car and show the detail panel appearing
TIP: Choose an interesting car (like a sports car or luxury vehicle)


[0:45-0:60] INSIGHTS & CONCLUSION (15 seconds)
-----------------------------------------------
"This visualization reveals interesting patterns - for example, sports cars
cluster in the high horsepower region, while more affordable sedans have
smaller engines. The interactive design allows users to explore individual
cars in detail while maintaining the overview of all relationships. Thank you!"

VISUAL: Pan across the visualization or highlight a specific pattern
TIP: End with a smile and clear conclusion

TECHNICAL TIPS FOR RECORDING
================================================================================

RECORDING SOFTWARE OPTIONS:
- OBS Studio (free, open-source) - https://obsproject.com/
- Loom (free tier available) - https://www.loom.com/
- Windows Game Bar (Windows 10/11) - Press Win+G
- macOS Screen Recording - Press Cmd+Shift+5
- Zoom (record yourself presenting)

VIDEO SETTINGS:
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (1080p)
- Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps
- Codec: H.264
- Format: MP4
- Bitrate: Keep file under 50MB (usually 5-10 Mbps works)

SCREEN SETUP:
✓ Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
✓ Clear your desktop or use a clean background
✓ Make sure your visualization is displayed at a good size
✓ Test your screen recording before the final take
✓ Ensure good lighting if showing yourself on camera

AUDIO TIPS:
✓ Record in a quiet room
✓ Use a decent microphone (even phone earbuds are better than laptop mic)
✓ Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
✓ Do a test recording to check audio levels
✓ Avoid background noise (turn off fans, AC, etc.)

PRESENTATION TIPS:
✓ Practice your script 2-3 times before recording
✓ Time yourself to stay under 60 seconds
✓ Use natural language, don't read robotically
✓ Show enthusiasm about your work
✓ Use your cursor to point at things you're describing
✓ Make actual interactions (click, hover) rather than just talking about them

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE SCRIPT (More Technical Focus)
================================================================================

If you prefer a more technical explanation:

"This D3.js visualization uses multiple visual channels to encode four
dimensions: position-x for engine displacement, position-y for horsepower,
hue for categorical vehicle type, and area for price. The design follows
Bertin's visual variables theory, utilizing both quantitative and categorical
encodings. Interactive features include hover tooltips for quick reference and
click-based detail views with a bonus radial star plot showing normalized
performance metrics across six dimensions. The visualization demonstrates
strong positive correlation between engine size and horsepower, with distinct
clusters emerging for different vehicle types."

(This is more academic and uses data visualization terminology)

================================================================================
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
================================================================================

✗ DON'T go over 60 seconds - trim your content if needed
✗ DON'T just read text on screen - demonstrate and interact
✗ DON'T speak too fast - viewers need time to follow
✗ DON'T forget to show the actual interactions working
✗ DON'T use poor quality audio - it's harder to fix later
✗ DON'T leave debug console or errors visible on screen
✗ DON'T forget to mention all 4 visual variables clearly
