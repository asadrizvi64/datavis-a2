QUESTION 1: MAIN PRINCIPLE OF SCATTERPLOT MATRICES
================================================================================

A scatterplot matrix (SPLOM) is a multivariate data visualization technique that
displays pairwise relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. The main
principle is to arrange multiple scatterplots in a grid format, where:

1. LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
   - Each row and column represents a different attribute/variable
   - The intersection of row i and column j shows a scatterplot of variable i
     (y-axis) versus variable j (x-axis)
   - The diagonal typically shows the distribution of each single variable
     (histograms, density plots, or variable names)

2. KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
   - Provides a comprehensive overview of all pairwise relationships
   - The matrix is symmetric: the plot at position (i,j) is a mirror/transpose
     of the plot at position (j,i) - same data but axes are swapped
   - Allows quick identification of correlations, clusters, and patterns across
     multiple dimensions

3. PURPOSE:
   - Exploratory data analysis to understand relationships between variables
   - Identifying potential correlations (positive, negative, or none)
   - Detecting outliers and unusual patterns across multiple dimensions
   - Selecting variables for further detailed analysis

================================================================================
QUESTION 2: NUMBER OF SCATTERPLOTS FOR n ATTRIBUTES
================================================================================

FORMULA:

For n attributes, the total number of cells in the matrix = n × n = n²

However, we need to consider which cells contain actual scatterplots:

1. FULL MATRIX (including diagonal and both triangles):
   Total cells = n²

2. EXCLUDING DIAGONAL:
   Number of scatterplots = n² - n = n(n - 1)

   This counts both upper and lower triangles (mirrored plots)

3. UNIQUE SCATTERPLOTS (excluding diagonal, counting only one triangle):
   Number of unique scatterplots = n(n - 1) / 2

EXPLANATION:
- The diagonal (n cells) shows single-variable distributions, not scatterplots
- The upper triangle and lower triangle each contain n(n-1)/2 scatterplots
- These are mirror images of each other (axes swapped)
- For truly unique pairwise comparisons, we only need one triangle

EXAMPLES:
- n = 3 attributes: 3(3-1)/2 = 3 unique scatterplots (or 6 if counting mirrors)
- n = 5 attributes: 5(5-1)/2 = 10 unique scatterplots (or 20 if counting mirrors)
- n = 10 attributes: 10(10-1)/2 = 45 unique scatterplots (or 90 if counting mirrors)

Most commonly, when people ask "how many scatterplots," they mean:
→ n(n - 1) / 2 unique pairwise relationships

QUESTION 3: SKETCH OF SCATTERPLOT MATRIX
================================================================================

See attached file: scatterplot_matrix_sketch.png

The sketch shows a 3×3 scatterplot matrix using three cars from the dataset:
- Attributes: Horsepower, MPG (City), and Engine Size
- Three example cars: Acura MDX, BMW M3, and Toyota Prius (or similar)
- Each cell shows the relationship between two attributes for these three cars

The sketch demonstrates:
✓ Diagonal showing attribute names/distributions
✓ Upper and lower triangles showing mirrored scatterplots
✓ Three data points (cars) plotted in each scatterplot
✓ Axis labels for each plot
✓ How to read relationships between attributes

================================================================================
QUESTION 4: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF SCATTERPLOT MATRICES
================================================================================

ADVANTAGES:
-----------

1. COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW:
   ✓ Shows all pairwise relationships at once
   ✓ Provides a holistic view of the entire dataset
   ✓ No need to create individual plots one by one

2. CORRELATION DETECTION:
   ✓ Easy to spot positive/negative correlations across multiple variable pairs
   ✓ Quick identification of which variables are related
   ✓ Helps in feature selection for machine learning models

3. PATTERN RECOGNITION:
   ✓ Clusters and groupings become visible across multiple dimensions
   ✓ Outliers can be identified in multiple contexts
   ✓ Non-linear relationships are visible

4. SPACE EFFICIENCY:
   ✓ Compact representation of many relationships
   ✓ Better than creating separate individual scatterplots
   ✓ Symmetric structure reduces redundancy (can show only one triangle)

5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
   ✓ Easy to compare the strength of different relationships
   ✓ Can quickly determine which pairs have the strongest associations
   ✓ Supports hypothesis generation and testing

6. STANDARDIZED LAYOUT:
   ✓ Familiar and intuitive structure
   ✓ Easy to navigate once you understand the principle
   ✓ Works well for exploratory data analysis


DISADVANTAGES:
--------------

1. SCALABILITY ISSUES:
   ✗ Becomes cluttered and unreadable with many attributes (typically >7-10)
   ✗ Number of plots grows quadratically: n² cells total
   ✗ Individual scatterplots become too small to read details
   ✗ Example: 15 attributes = 225 cells = overwhelming

2. SCREEN REAL ESTATE:
   ✗ Requires significant display space
   ✗ May not work well on small screens or mobile devices
   ✗ Individual plots lose detail when matrix is large
   ✗ Hard to print effectively on standard paper

3. OVERPLOTTING IN LARGE DATASETS:
   ✗ With thousands of data points, individual plots become dense black masses
   ✗ Hard to see patterns when points overlap extensively
   ✗ May need transparency, sampling, or hexbin alternatives

4. LIMITED DIMENSIONALITY:
   ✗ Only shows 2D projections of potentially higher-dimensional relationships
   ✗ Cannot encode additional variables simultaneously (unlike single scatterplots
      that can use size, color, shape)
   ✗ Misses complex interactions between 3+ variables

5. COGNITIVE LOAD:
   ✗ Difficult for users to compare patterns across many small plots
   ✗ Eye must jump between different plots to synthesize information
   ✗ Easy to miss important relationships in the visual clutter
   ✗ Overwhelming for non-expert users

6. REDUNDANCY:
   ✗ Lower triangle duplicates upper triangle (mirrored)
   ✗ While this provides confirmation, it also wastes space
   ✗ Some implementations only show one triangle, but this can be confusing

7. TEMPORAL/SEQUENTIAL DATA:
   ✗ Doesn't naturally show time series or sequential patterns
   ✗ No indication of the order in which data points occur
   ✗ Better visualizations exist for temporal data

8. CATEGORICAL VARIABLES:
   ✗ Less effective when many variables are categorical
   ✗ Scatterplots work best with continuous numerical data
   ✗ Alternative visualizations needed for mixed data types


BEST USE CASES:
---------------
- Initial exploratory analysis of medium-sized datasets (4-10 variables)
- Datasets with primarily continuous numerical variables
- When you need to quickly identify which variable pairs to investigate further
- Academic and research settings where comprehensive overview is needed

WHEN TO AVOID:
--------------
- More than 10-12 variables (too cluttered)
- Very large datasets (millions of points) without sampling
- Data with many categorical variables
- When specific hypotheses need detailed single-plot analysis
- Mobile or small-screen presentations

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Scatterplot matrices are powerful tools for exploratory data analysis and
understanding multivariate relationships. They work best with moderate numbers of
continuous variables and medium-sized datasets. For our car dataset with 13
attributes, a SPLOM would be at the upper limit of usability - which is why
choosing 4 key attributes for our interactive scatterplot was a better approach
for detailed analysis.
